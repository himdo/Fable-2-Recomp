# Fable 2 — ReXGlue Recompiled Project
First and for most this project was made to test the capabilities of local and open source AI. This project was made using Qwen3.8 27b. After about an hour it got the game running. Then after a large amount of human trial and error I was able to get enough of the functions mapped to be able to complete the game. I currently do not consider this to be fully complete as I have yet to 100% the game. The sha256 of the iso that started this project is: "685a0d3bea9718812f17bcd155907a5359a548b6d3d8342dd2a6c944f45e35ff" and its the Fable 2 GOTY for USA and Europe.

Recompilation of Fable 2 (Xbox 360, title ID 4D5307F1) using the [ReXGlue SDK](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk) v0.10.0. Guest PPC code is statically recompiled to C++ at build time by `rexglue codegen`, driven by `fable_2_manifest.toml`.

## Windows launcher

The optional WPF launcher detects the original game edition and configures
output resolution, internal render scale, anisotropic filtering, FXAA, VSync,
window/fullscreen mode and a 30/60/120/144/165/240/unlimited FPS limit. It keeps its preferences
in `launcher-settings.toml` and writes `fable_2.toml`, preserving other settings
and a one-time backup. Preferences survive the runtime rewriting its config.
The game-folder selection starts empty and remembers only the user's saved
location. Game files can live separately; the launcher uses `--game_data_root`.
Both applications are named Fable 2 Recompiled and use new project-owned icons.

Build with the .NET 8 SDK using `build.cmd launcher`, or
`build.cmd launcher-self-contained` to bundle the desktop runtime. Place
`out\tests\launcher-build\Fable2Launcher.exe` beside `fable_2.exe` and its generated
`fable2_build.json`. See [launcher details](launcher/README.md).
For the source-built audio fallback, working FPS limit and matched renderer,
use `build.cmd -release fable_2`; see [build instructions, tests and known
limits](docs/RUNTIME_FIXES.md). Remaster assets and save editing are not included.



# Notes for running the game
- **How to extract:** rip the disc to an ISO, then open it with **[XboxImageExtractor](https://github.com/dromex1/XboxImageExtractor)** — a GUI tool for Xbox 360 game images. It lists the image's filesystem; select `default.xex` and `data` and extract them into the project root (`data` extract as folders).
- **You must supply the game content yourself** (it is not in the repo): rip the Fable 2 GOTY (USA/EU) disc (the one with SHA-256 above) and put `default.xex` and `data/` in the project root. The build does not copy this into the build directories   
- **Saves live in `<build dir>\saves\`** — back that folder up to keep your progress, and copy it between build trees (Debug/Release) or machines to carry a save over.
- The `--game_data_root <path>` override still points the content root at a different tree (e.g. to run from a shared content copy without staging); saves/cache still land next to the exe.
- Although this was made for the US / Europe GOTY version I have been able to run the following regions: Germany, France, Italy, Russia, and Spain. Your milage may very if you use those regions.


## Running

To run the game you must:
1) Extract a downloaded copy release of the game 
2) Extract the "data" and "default.xex" from your copy of the game, See "How to extract" for more info on that
3) Run the fable.exe program and if no errors pop up then the game should launch and you are good to go
  - If an error pops up about the hash being wrong try to extract a different version of the game and then try again.


Optional command-line overrides (all normal `--cvar value` args):

| Argument | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--game_data_root <path>` | Use a different content directory (beats the exe-dir-only search) |
| `--update_data_root <path>` | Optional update content root |
| `--window_width` / `--window_height` / `--fullscreen` | Presentation options |
| `--keyboard_gamepad_map <map>` | Host keyboard -> guest gamepad button map (see below) |

## User config (fable2_config.toml)

The recomp has its own human-readable user config, `fable2_config.toml`, next
to the exe — separate from `fable_2.toml`, which is the ReXGlue SDK's cvar
config. It is staged by the build (once; user edits survive rebuilds) and the
game recreates it with defaults on launch if it is ever missing. Loaded in
`Fable2App::OnPostInitLogging()`; code in `src/core/fable2_config.{h,cpp}`.

- Missing keys -> built-in defaults; wrong types / unknown sections -> logged
  warnings, defaults used; a syntax error -> dialog + defaults (never blocks
  launch).
- To add a setting: add a member to `fable2::config::Values` (with default),
  read it in `Load()`, and document the key in `config/fable2_config.toml`
  **and** the embedded template in `src/core/fable2_config.cpp` (keep both in
  sync).
- Settings that back an SDK cvar (currently the `[input]` section:
  `keyboard_gamepad_map`, `mouse_look`, `mouse_look_scale`) are seeded into
  the cvar at startup — but only when no higher-priority
  source set it: `fable_2.toml` (cvar config), `REX_*` env vars, and the
  command line (e.g. `--keyboard_gamepad_map`) still win, and the F3 console
  can still change the value live.
- The `[patches]` section holds runtime toggles for the recomp-level
  (mid-asm hook) patches, consulted by the hook bodies on every call
  (`src/core/fable2_hooks.cpp`) — flip one and relaunch to A/B a patch with no
  rebuild. Currently: `fps_60` (60 FPS hook; `true` = main loop ~60/s,
  `false` = original 30/s). Guest-image data patches are a different file:
  `fable2_patches.toml` (see above).



## Keyboard controls

The game normally reads a gamepad via the Xbox 360 `XamInputGetState` API. A
synthetic "keyboard gamepad" input driver (`src/input/keyboard_gamepad.h`) is added
on top of the default SDL driver, so host keyboard keys can drive the guest on
top of (OR-merged with) whatever a real gamepad reports. The physical pad
keeps working; the keyboard just adds buttons. It is wired up in
`Fable2App::OnPreSetup` via `config.input_factory`.

The mapping is the `keyboard_gamepad_map` cvar, format `Key:Button,Key:Button,...`. Its default is no longer hardcoded in the binary: it comes from `[input] keyboard_gamepad_map` in `fable2_config.toml` (see User config above), which you can edit to remap permanently. The command line and the F3 console still override it per-launch / live.

- **Key** — a host key name understood by `rex::ui::ParseVirtualKey`
  (`E`, `Space`, `LeftShift`, `F1`, ...), or a mouse button: `LMB` (left),
  `RMB` (right), `MMB` (middle), and `XMB1`/`XMB2` (side buttons). Mouse
  button names are case-insensitive; a held mouse button behaves exactly like
  a held key.
- **Button** — a guest gamepad input: `A`, `B`, `X`, `Y`, `LB`/`RB` (shoulders),
  `LT`/`RT` (triggers), `Up`/`Down`/`Left`/`Right` (dpad), `Pause` (Start),
  `Select` (Back), `L3`/`R3` (thumb clicks), and `StickUp`/`StickDown`/
  `StickLeft`/`StickRight` (left thumbstick, full deflection while held).

The default layout (mouse buttons plus keyboard) is:

| Key(s) | Guest input |
|---|---|
| `LMB` | `X` |
| `RMB` | `Y` |
| `MMB` / `B` | `B` |
| `Shift` / `E` | `A` |
| `W` `A` `S` `D` | Left stick (up / left / down / right) |
| `Q` / `R` | Left / Right trigger |
| `Z` / `Tab` | Left / Right shoulder |
| Arrow keys | Dpad up / down / left / right |
| `Escape` | Pause (Start) |
| `M` | Select (Back) |


Remap at launch without recompiling, e.g.

```
fable_2.exe --keyboard_gamepad_map "E:A,B:B,Space:L3,Enter:Start"
```

### Mouse look (right stick)

Mouse movement is mapped to the guest **right stick** for camera control. The
movement since the previous poll is converted into stick deflection, so you
**sweep the mouse to look and stop to stop**. Two cvars control it:

| Argument | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--mouse_look <bool>` | Enable/disable mouse look (default `true`) |
| `--mouse_look_scale <n>` | Sensitivity: right-stick units per pixel of mouse movement (default `256`; larger = more sensitive) |

The defaults come from `[input] mouse_look` / `[input] mouse_look_scale` in
`fable2_config.toml` (edit there to change them permanently), the command
line overrides per launch, and both cvars are hot-reloadable from the in-game
console, so you can dial in the sensitivity live. Example: `fable_2.exe
--mouse_look_scale 512` for a more sensitive camera.

All cvars above are hot-reloadable, so they can also be changed from the in-game console.

## F5 — run an external Lua script

Pressing **F5** (host keyboard) runs an external Lua file in the in-game Lua
state, exactly the way the game's own `RunScript(path)` global does — but
triggered from the host. This lets you drop a plain `.lua` file on disk and run
it against the live game (no recompile of the scripts needed).

- **Default file:** `data/scripts/recomp/F5.lua` (the build stages
  `src/lua/*.lua` into `data/scripts/recomp/` next to the exe). The shipped
  `F5.lua` snapshots the hero's position (`QuestManager.HeroEntity:GetPosition()`)
  and shows `X / Y / Z` in a message box.
- **Path:** set by the `f5_lua_path` cvar (default `scripts/recomp/F5.lua`,
  resolved relative to the VFS root `data/`). Override per-launch with
  `fable_2.exe --f5_lua_path "scripts/other/MyScript.lua"`.
- **How it works:** `src/core/fable2_f5_lua.h` captures the
  `CScriptManager::RunScript` callable the first time the game loads a `.lua`
  script (via a probe on the LuaPlus bound-method dispatcher), then replays that
  call with your path when F5 is pressed. The file is loaded fresh on each press,
  so you can edit it live (the VFS re-reads it).
- **The script runs in the game's global Lua environment**, so it has the full
  game API (`QuestManager`, `Debug`, `GUI`, `Creature`, `Player`, ...). Plain
  text is fine — `RunScript`/`loadfile` compile it for you.

Implementation: F5 edge-detection in `src/input/keyboard_gamepad.h`, a per-frame
replay from the `MainRenderLoop` hook in `src/diagnostics/fps_meter.h`, and the
string-build + `RunScript` call in `src/core/fable2_f5_lua.h`.

## F6 — graphics enhancements

Press **F6** in game for the **Graphics Enhancements** menu: modern effects
added to the game's own rendering - ambient occlusion (GTAO), global
illumination, contact shadows, volumetric light shafts, height fog,
screen-space reflections, sharpening and color grading - and *material
shaders*, rewritten versions of the game's own shaders with soft sun shadows
(PCSS) and physically based highlights. Tick an effect to turn it on, open it
to tune it; changes apply instantly and **Save** keeps them. Presets go from
Off to Ultra. The effects work on SDR and HDR displays, and are complete on
Direct3D 12 (the default renderer).

Details, every setting and how it works:

shaders: [materials/README.md](materials/README.md).\

# Notes for dev who want to work on the build:

## Guest-image patches (fable2_patches.toml)

Data patches for the loaded `default.xex` guest image (Xenia game-patches
format), applied before the guest module launches: `Fable2App::OnPostLoadXexImage()`
→ `fable2::patches::Load()` + `ApplyAll()` (code in `src/core/fable2_patches.{h,cpp}`).
Same lifecycle as the user config: staged by the build, recreated with the
built-in defaults if missing, and a broken file falls back to the built-ins
(dialog + log) so it never blocks launch. Each `[[patch]]` has an `enabled`
toggle (default true) — flip it in the file and relaunch to A/B a patch with
no rebuild. **Scope: data patches only** — code-region ops are inert in this
recomp (guest `.text` is never executed); code patches are mid-asm hooks
instead. Full details, the current patch list, and how code patches work:
`docs/patches.md`.

## Guest function-call tracing (fable2_func_trace.log)

To figure out what each recompiled function does, every guest function entry
can be logged by name. Codegen emits `REX_FUNC_PROLOGUE()` at the top of
every function in `generated/default/fable_2_recomp.*.cpp`; the build hooks
that one macro (via `src/core/fable2_func_trace.h`, appended to the recompiled
PCH after the generated pch — no generated files are modified) so each entry
logs its name to `fable2_func_trace.log` next to the exe. Consecutive calls
of the same function are run-length encoded (per thread) to keep the file
small:

```
GetNewGameLoadingGlobal
sub_82189708 x 4821
LoadingScreen_Virtual43
sub_82CC1BC0 x 3
...
```

(`x N` means that function was called N times in a row; a bare name is a run
of one.)

**Session summary:** call counts are accumulated separately and written to
`fable2_func_summary.log` (same folder), one line per function, sorted by
total count:

```
18422331 x MainRenderLoop_82B9CD68
9711204 x __restgprlr_28
54 x Story_FirstChildCombat
```

It's refreshed every 5 s while tracing (and once more on clean exit), so you
can watch it in another window to see at a glance what's being called; the
last write is at most ~5 s stale even if the game exits via ExitProcess.
Counts respect the same on/off + filter as the text log.

Off by default (one atomic load per call when off). Enable with:

```
set FABLE2_FUNC_TRACE=1            rem every guest function entry
set FABLE2_FUNC_TRACE_FILTER=LoadingScreen   rem optional: only names containing this
```

Either output can be turned off independently (default: both on):
`FABLE2_FUNC_TRACE_LOG=0` skips `fable2_func_trace.log` (summary only),
`FABLE2_FUNC_TRACE_SUMMARY=0` skips `fable2_func_summary.log` (trace only).

or at runtime from a named-function override (see `src/diagnostics/fps_probe.h` for the
override pattern): `Fable2FuncTraceSetEnabled(true)` /
`Fable2FuncTraceSetFilter("LoadingScreen")` /
`Fable2FuncTraceSetSubsOnly(true)` /
`Fable2FuncTraceSetLogEnabled(false)` /
`Fable2FuncTraceSetSummaryEnabled(false)` / `Fable2FuncTraceFlush()`
(declared `extern "C"` in `src/core/fable2_func_trace.h`).

**Naming mode** (`FABLE2_FUNC_TRACE_SUBS_ONLY=1`): log only the unnamed
guest functions - names matching `sub_` + hex digits - dropping named
functions, the `__savegprlr_*`/`__restgprlr_*`/`__savevmx_*` register
helpers, and `xstart`. Both the text log and the summary honor it, so the
summary becomes a ranked list of the unnamed hot functions to name next.
Composes with the substring filter (`FABLE2_FUNC_TRACE_FILTER=82B9` narrows
to an address range).

**Launcher:** `fable2-functrace.cmd` (staged next to the exe) does the env
var dance for you and renames the previous session's log to
`fable2_func_trace_prev.log` first:

Arguments are keywords in any order (`subs` enables naming mode,
`trace`/`summary` pick which output file(s) are written, the backend word
picks the GPU path, anything else is the substring filter):

```
fable2-functrace.cmd                  D3D12, trace every call
fable2-functrace.cmd vulkan           Vulkan, trace every call
fable2-functrace.cmd subs             naming mode: only sub_<hex> functions
fable2-functrace.cmd subs LoadingScreen   naming mode + substring filter
fable2-functrace.cmd d3d12 82B9 subs  D3D12, address-range naming mode
fable2-functrace.cmd summary          summary file only, no trace log
fable2-functrace.cmd trace            trace log only, no summary file
```

With no `trace`/`summary` keyword both files are written (the default).
`summary` is the cheap option for long sessions - it avoids the multi-GB
sequential log while still accumulating the call counts.

It writes its own lightweight log (same pattern as `fps_probe.log`) rather
than the SDK spdlog logger, which would be far too slow at Fable 2's call
rate. To remove the feature: delete the `target_precompile_headers` block in
CMakeLists.txt + `src/core/fable2_func_trace.h` and rebuild.



## Remote control (automated input channel)

`fable_2.exe` runs a localhost TCP **remote control server** so an external
automation harness can drive the guest gamepad over JSON-lines messages —
no human at the keyboard. Design doc: `plans/ai-remote-input-control.md`.

**Debug builds only.** This is a debugging/automation channel — it opens a
localhost TCP port and injects guest input — so it must not ship to players.
It is gated on the `FABLE2_REMOTE_CONTROL` macro, defined only for the Debug
build; Release / RelWithDebInfo builds compile out the pad driver + server
entirely (no port is opened and `fable2_control.py` is not staged).

- **Where:** `127.0.0.1:8791` by default (configurable, see below). One JSON
  object per line; every request gets exactly one response line; keep-alive
  connections are supported.
- **How:** a second synthetic pad driver
  (`src/input/remote_gamepad_driver.h`) is registered next to the keyboard driver,
  fed by the server (`src/input/remote_control_server.h`). It OR-merges with the
  human pads and is **not** gated on window focus, so the AI can drive the
  game while it's in the background.

Quick start (from the build dir, game running):

```
python tools\fable2_control.py ping
python tools\fable2_control.py press A --hold 120
python tools\fable2_control.py get-state
python tools\fable2_control.py script --file repro.json
```

Or speak the protocol directly (any language):

```
> {"cmd":"press","input":"RT","hold_ms":900}
< {"ok":true,"input":"RT","release_in_ms":900}
> {"cmd":"script","steps":[
      {"delay_ms":500,"op":"press","input":"LB","hold_ms":2000},
      {"delay_ms":1000,"op":"press","input":"A","hold_ms":80}]}
< {"ok":true,"duration_ms":2500}
```

`hold_ms` ≤ 0 (or omitted) means *hold until released/cleared*; a positive value
auto-releases after that many ms. In a `script`, each step's `delay_ms` is a **gap
since the previous step** on a single clock — the example presses LB at t=500 (held to
t=2500) and A at t=1500 (held to t=1580), so `duration_ms` (when the last input stops
being active) is 2500.

Commands: `ping`, `info`, `auth`, `press` (`input`, `hold_ms`, `value`),
`release`, `stick` (`input` = `StkLx`/`StkLy`/`StkRx`/`StkRy`, `value`,
`hold_ms`), `state` (sticky baseline: `buttons[]`, `triggers{LT,RT}`,
`stk{lx,ly,rx,ry}`), `clear`, `script` (atomic timed sequence), `get_state`,
`game_state` (current boot/menu state, see below), `screenshot` (`path`; save
the current game frame as a PNG, see below), `cvar` (get/set any
cvar by name), `enable`/`disable`. Input names match the
keyboard-gamepad vocabulary (`A`/`B`/`X`/`Y`, `LB`/`RB`, `LT`/`RT`,
`Up`/`Down`/`Left`/`Right`, `Start`/`Back`, `L3`/`R3`, stick direction
shorthands). `StkLy` positive = forward (Fable 2 convention). `script` is a
single atomic message, so a repro sequence runs with no network round-trips
between steps.

### Game state

`game_state` reports which boot/menu screen the game is on so the AI can
navigate and verify its actions:

```
python tools\fable2_control.py game-state
> {"cmd":"game_state"}
< {"ok":true,"state":{"code":2,"name":"PressAScreen"}}
```

The classifier samples once per second on a background thread (independent of
the render loop, so it keeps working during the movie, which renders video with
no UI text) and reports one of:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `?` (Unknown) | Arena not mapped yet / undetermined (first ~1 s). |
| `PreMainMenu` | Splash / intro, before the "Press A" prompt. |
| `PressAScreen` | The "Press A to start" prompt is on screen. |
| `MainMenuMovie` | The idle movie is playing (no prompt / menu). |
| `MainMenu` | The main menu (reached by pressing A on the prompt). |

This follows the game's own state machine:
`PreMainMenu →(time)→ PressAScreen →(time)→ MainMenuMovie →(time)→
PressAScreen`, with `PressAScreen →(A)→ MainMenu` and
`MainMenuMovie →(A)→ PressAScreen`. The prompt vs. the menu are visually
indistinguishable (same element-list draw rate), so the transition into the
menu is driven by the A-press, observed on the final merged pad state (remote +
keyboard + physical — it works no matter which input drives A) and latched with
its exact timestamp. State changes are logged to the in-game logger
(`REXSYS_INFO`, same channel as the remote control) on transition only, and
every sample is written to `fable2_state_probe.log` when
`FABLE2_STATE_PROBE=1` is set.

### Screenshot

`screenshot` saves the **current game frame** as a PNG so the AI harness can
see what the game is showing:

```
python tools\fable2_control.py screenshot shots/after_jump.png
> {"cmd":"screenshot","path":"C:/shots/after_jump.png"}
< {"ok":true,"path":"C:/shots/after_jump.png","width":1280,"height":720,"bytes":2765798,"avg_luma":120}
```

`path` (required, UTF-8) is where the PNG is written; parent directories are
created automatically. The frame is read **in-process from the renderer's guest
output texture** — the exact frame the game just rendered, in GPU memory at the
guest's native resolution (1280x720 for Fable 2) — not from the desktop. So the
picture is the complete game frame even while other windows cover it or the game
is unfocused, and occluding windows never appear in it. Works with both the D3D12
and Vulkan GPU plugins (each implements `CaptureGuestOutput`). Each capture
blocks the connection for a few hundred milliseconds. Implementation:
`src/diagnostics/fable2_frame_capture.h`.

Config (`[remote]` in `fable2_config.toml`): `enabled` (default `true`),
`host` (`127.0.0.1`; `0.0.0.0` exposes it on all interfaces), `port`
(`8791`; if busy, `+1..+9` are tried, the bound port is logged at startup),
`token` (empty = no auth; when set, each connection's first line must be
`{"cmd":"auth","token":"..."}`). Every received command is logged (audit
trail) to `logs/`.

## Building

Everything the build needs is either in this repo or auto-fetched — **no
hardcoded paths**. Prerequisites (all standard tools):

- **CMake** ≥ 3.25 (on PATH)
- **LLVM** (clang/clang++/lld) — on PATH or the default `C:\Program Files\LLVM` install
- **Ninja** (on PATH, `%USERPROFILE%\bin`, or the WinGet package dir)
- **Internet** on first build — `build.cmd` auto-downloads the prebuilt
  ReXGlue SDK v0.10.0 (~100 MB) from the
  [official release](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk/releases/tag/v0.10.0)
  into `out\tooling\rexglue-sdk-0.10.0\`. A compatible official SDK on PATH
  is used instead if present. Downloads never replace the source submodule.
- **Python and Git** for code generation and source-SDK preparation; **Visual
  Studio Build Tools / Windows SDK** (x64 developer shell) for the native build.

```
build.cmd               # configure + fable_2_codegen (runs rexglue codegen on the manifest)
build.cmd fable_2       # configure + build the full executable
build.cmd <target>      # any other CMake target
build.cmd -release [t]  # build as Release (-O3) instead of Debug (-r is short form)
```

The first `build.cmd` run fetches the official SDK if needed under `out/tooling`.
Both Debug and Release build the pinned, patched SDK from source; see
[runtime build requirements](docs/RUNTIME_FIXES.md). Game content is required
for code generation but is never published with this repository.

Manual/advanced setup (normally not needed):

```
tools\setup_sdk.cmd           # fetch the prebuilt SDK only (codegen tool)
tools\build_runtime_sdk.cmd   # build the D3D12 + Vulkan runtime/plugin from
                              # thirdparty\rexglue-sdk (what build.cmd runs)
```

If `git submodule` fails with `fork: Resource temporarily unavailable`
(an MSYS `0xC0000142` fork failure seen on some Windows hosts),
`tools/prepare_runtime_sdk.py` falls back to fetching each SDK dependency with
plain `git fetch`/`checkout`.

The build also accepts explicit overrides if you keep the SDK elsewhere:
`cmake -DREXGLUE_SDK_ROOT=<prebuilt SDK root> -DREXGLUE_SDK_SOURCE=<SDK source>`
(`build.cmd` sets `REXGLUE_SDK_ROOT`/`REXGLUE_SDK_SOURCE` from its own search).

The graphics enhancements are commits in the SDK the `thirdparty/rexglue-sdk`
submodule points at; the material shaders in `materials/` are rebuilt with
`python tools/build_material_shaders.py`. See

- Toolchain: the `win-amd64-debug` preset (Ninja + clang) by default. The SDK's public headers use clang builtins (`__builtin_bswap32`, `__VA_OPT__`), so plain MSVC `cl` cannot compile the generated code — a `win-msvc-debug` preset exists but only works for targets that don't compile `generated/`.
- **Release builds:** `build.cmd` defaults to the `win-amd64-debug` preset (`-O0`, `out\build\win-amd64-debug`). Pass the `-release` flag (short form: `-r`) to select the `win-amd64-release` preset (`-O3`, `out\build\win-amd64-release`):

  ```
  build.cmd -release fable_2_codegen
  build.cmd -release fable_2
  ```

  Both configurations build the patched source SDK, with separate SDK build/staging trees. Release stages `rexruntime.dll` and `rexgpu-xenos.dll`; Debug stages `rexruntimed.dll` and `rexgpu-xenosd.dll`. **Debug builds are drastically slower at runtime** — the recompiled guest code, the runtime, and the Xenos GPU emulator all run at `-O0` with assertions enabled — so use Release for any performance-sensitive run. Omit the flag to build Debug again; the two build trees are independent and can coexist. After updating, rerun `build.cmd` to refresh the SDK selection in an existing CMake cache.
- Codegen runs as part of the build and re-runs automatically when `fable_2_manifest.toml` or `default.xex` change (tracked via the generated DEPFILE).
- A full clean build recompiles ~291 generated translation units (60,462 guest functions).

## GPU backends (D3D12 and Vulkan)

`tools/build_runtime_sdk.cmd` (run by `build.cmd`) compiles the pinned SDK
source with **both** Xenos backends, for Debug and Release, into one matched
`rexruntime[d].dll` + `rexgpu-xenos[d].dll` pair. No second plugin and no DLL
swapping: the backend is picked at launch.

| Where | Setting |
|---|---|
| Launcher | **Renderer** dropdown (writes `gpu_backend` to `fable_2.toml`) |
| `fable2_config.toml` | `[graphics] backend = "d3d12"` or `"vulkan"` |
| Command line | `fable_2.exe --gpu_backend=vulkan` (or `fable2.cmd vulkan`) |

Priority follows the other cvars: command line > `fable_2.toml` >
`fable2_config.toml`. `Fable2App::OnPreSetup` loads the plugin with the chosen
backend and brings up its device and presenter immediately; if that fails (no
Vulkan driver, no D3D12 support) it falls back to the other backend and logs
`[gpu] falling back from ... to ...`. The startup log records
`[gpu] requested=<x> running=<y>`. The old `--gpu_plugin=xenos-vulkan`
spelling still selects Vulkan.

`fable_2_vulkan_smoke` (`src/vulkan_smoke.cpp`) is the original standalone
Vulkan bring-up test (window + clear color) and is independent of the game.
## Manifest highlights (fable_2_manifest.toml)

Migrated from the XenonRecomp config (`XenonRecomp/fable2.toml`):

- 87 manual function boundaries. ReXGlue forbids the overlapping boundaries XenonRecomp allowed: three nested pairs were trimmed to end where the inner function begins, and `0x82C8D3F0` keeps its original full size with the nested `0x82C8D4E8` entry removed (the gap-fill otherwise extended the outer and emitted an illegal cross-function `goto`). Original sizes are recorded in the file's comments and in `XenonRecomp/fable2.toml`.
- 13 "gap seed" function entries (no size — the scanner sizes them) for branch targets the auto-discovery never registered: a chain of 8-byte thunks at `0x82C000F0`–`0x82C00128` plus stragglers (`0x82BEA25C`, `0x82CD7948`, `0x82C14D58`, `0x82F279D8`, `0x82E7E4F8`, ...).
- `setjmp_address = 0x83000200`, `longjmp_address = 0x82CA9260`, and two `[[invalid_instructions]]` data-table skips, carried over verbatim.
- The XenonRecomp register save/restore helper addresses (`restgprlr_14` etc.) have no ReXGlue equivalent and are preserved only as comments.
- Known runtime risk: codegen logs a handful of non-fatal "Unresolved conditional branch" warnings (e.g. `0x82C8D408`, `0x82C99E74`, `0x82C9A0BC`); those paths emit `REX_FATAL` if hit.

## Function naming rule (important)

A manifest `name` becomes a C symbol: codegen emits the function body as
`__imp__<name>` (extern "C"). A name must therefore NOT equal an XAPI export
of `rexruntimed.dll` (the DLL exports `__imp__<XAPI name>` for every
xboxkrnl/xam hook). If it does, the local definition silently shadows the
DLL import at link time (no linker error), and the generated import-thunk
registration (`fable_2_register.cpp`) routes XAPI calls into the guest
function body instead of the SDK kernel hook. That is what broke audio when
the game-internal KeWait re-implementations were named
`KeWaitForSingleObject` / `KeWaitForMultipleObjects`: the xboxkrnl import
thunks (0x832B28AC / 0x832B2CDC) started landing in the guest wrappers,
whose timeout field is milliseconds while kernel callers pass 100ns units
(0 = infinite). They are named `..._Guest` for this reason — keep it that
way. Check before committing name changes:

```
python tools/check_manifest_collisions.py
```
